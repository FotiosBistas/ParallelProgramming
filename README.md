# ParallelProgramming
This repository contains the exercise sets assigned in the 2023 parallel-programming class in AUEB.  

# OpenMP

OpenMP, which stands for Open Multi-Processing, is an application programming interface (API) that supports shared memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran. It provides a simple and portable way to parallelize code across multiple cores or processors in a shared memory system. OpenMP allows developers to specify parallel regions, which are portions of code that can be executed concurrently by multiple threads.

By using directives, programmers can easily identify parallelizable sections of code and specify how the workload should be divided among threads. OpenMP also offers a range of synchronization and data-sharing mechanisms to control the behavior of parallel execution. It simplifies the process of writing parallel programs, enabling developers to achieve significant speedup on multi-core systems.

You can find a detailed report of the exercise set in the OpenMP directory.
